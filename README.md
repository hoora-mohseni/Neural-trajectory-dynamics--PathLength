# Neural-trajectory-dynamics – PathLength  
Scripts for the analyses and plots of the manuscript: *[Neural trajectory dynamics during human motor learning]*  

## Overview  
This repository contains the MATLAB scripts used for computing neural trajectory dynamics and calculating path-length metrics in relation to behavioural / experimental variables, as reported in the accompanying paper.
